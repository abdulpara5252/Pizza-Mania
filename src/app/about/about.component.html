<p style="padding: 15px;"> The popularity of pizza in the United States began with the Italian community in New York City. The first pizzeria appeared there in 1905. After World War II the pizza industry boomed. Soon there was scarcely a hamlet without a pizzeria. Sausage, bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers are traditional toppings familiar to many Americans, but ingredients as varied as arugula, pancetta, and truffles have found their way onto pizzas there. Variations are also often tied to different regions in the country, Chicagoâ€™s deep-dish pizza and California-style pizza among them.</p>
